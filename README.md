# AC3.2-PhotoMomentsTable

Use the ```Photos``` framework to make queries on the Photo Library and display the results.

### Original Homework
Complete Exercises 2 - 4 (Table View) at the [end of the lesson](https://github.com/C4Q/AC3.2/tree/master/lessons/unit6/photos_framework)

And that is:

1. Build a table view. Using the cellForRowAt from the NSHipster post as a model, get the data you need from the Moments section above to get your PHAssets. It won't be a simple array as sketched in the post but rather hold a reference to the fetchResult. With that you'll be able to implement the data source delegate methods by drilling down into assets as illustrated in the printAssetsInList function.
1. Customize that table view cell, for goodness sakes.
1. Segue to the full image. What a surprise.
